# Landing-Page
simple landing page with sections, and a navbar that dynamically adds anchors for each added section - using js functionality, in a smooth transition - also using js functionality as required

Each section in view has an active state that adds style to it, using, js getBoundingClientRect() to determine the active scrolled section of the viewport
